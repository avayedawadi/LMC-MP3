# Communicating With Nonprofits

Most nonprofits we work with are **not** technical.

Our job is to explain what we're doing without getting too into the weeds

## Rules

### 1. Avoid Jargon

Use plain language whenever possible.

### 2. Explain Impact, Not Implementation

Nonprofits care about outcomes.

- BAD = "We added client-side validation for malformed payloads."
- GOOD = "We added checks so users can't submit broken forms anymore."

### 3. Confirm Assumptions

- Repeat requirements back in your own words to check understanding.
- Also, sometimes the non-profits ARE well versed
    - Have a conversation first to understand where they stand, and adjust your communication accordingly

### 4. Maintain a Professional & Respectful Tone

- Be polite and patient at all times, no matter the issue
- The nonprofits have the same goal as us, and we are working together to achieve it
- NEVER give blame or use accusatory language, talk through issues maturely

### 5. Treat Nonprofits Like Clients

- Understand what exactly they need
- Be honest with them about what is and isn't possible
- At the end of the day, we are delivering value for them. Make sure to listen to them and give them space to voice their concerns.
