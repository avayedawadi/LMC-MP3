# Communicating With Nonprofits

Most nonprofits we work with are **not** technical.

Our job: explain what we're doing in language they can understand.

## Rules

### 1. Avoid Jargon

Use plain language whenever possible.

### 2. Explain Impact, Not Implementation

Nonprofits care about outcomes.

- ❌ "We added client-side validation for malformed payloads."
- ✅ "We added checks so users can't submit broken forms anymore."

### 3. Send Regular Updates

Each update should include:
- What we completed
- What we're doing next
- Any blockers
- Questions where we need their input

### 4. Confirm Assumptions

Repeat requirements back in your own words to check understanding.
