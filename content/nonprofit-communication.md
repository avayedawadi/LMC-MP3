# Communicating With Nonprofits

Most nonprofits we work with are **not** technical.

Our job is to explain what we're doing without getting too into the weeds

## Rules

### 1. Avoid Jargon

Use plain language whenever possible.

### 2. Explain Impact, Not Implementation

Nonprofits care about outcomes.

- BAD = "We added client-side validation for malformed payloads."
- GOOD = "We added checks so users can't submit broken forms anymore."

### 3. Confirm Assumptions

- Repeat requirements back in your own words to check understanding.
- Also, sometimes the non-profits ARE well versed
    - Have a conversation first to understand where they stand, and adjust your communication accordingly
