# Introduction

Welcome to the **Bits of Good Technical Communication Toolkit**.

This site teaches **Developers, PMs, Designers, and EMs** how we write,
communicate, and document our work when building software for nonprofits.

Our goals:

- Help new members onboard quickly
- Improve clarity across roles
- Ensure knowledge persists beyond any single semester
- Communicate clearly with nontechnical nonprofit partners

If you're new, start with [Getting Started](/getting-started).
