# Introduction

Welcome to the **Bits of Good Technical Communication Toolkit Onboarding Guide**.

This site teaches **Developers, PMs (Product Managers), Designers, and EMs (Engineering Managers)** how to properly write documentation, communicate with non-profits, write tickets, etc. This is to help us effectively communicate as an organization in a clear and concise manner.

With our technical communication, we have a couple goals:

- All communication should be easy to understand for the group being communicated to
    - If talking to non-profits, technical jargon should be kept to basically 0
    - If talking to developers, make sure to explain project context
    - etc.
- Ensuring that documentation allows knowledge to persist for students in the future
- All non-technical stakeholders must be able to understand projects
    - This is at the core of our goals

If you're new, start with [Getting Started](/getting-started).
