# Writing & Communication Guidelines

These rules make our documentation clear and easy to use.

## Core Principles

1. **It is better to be simple over complex**
2. **Keep sentences and paragraphs short**
3. **Use examples where possible to describe features**
4. **Screenshots are the best way to convey information**
5. **Keep pure jargon to a minimum**

## Style Rules

- Use headings and bullet points
- Use code blocks for commands and config
- Avoid unexplained jargon
- Prefer diagrams when describing flows
