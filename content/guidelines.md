# Writing & Communication Guidelines

These rules make our documentation clear and easy to use.

## Core Principles

1. **Simple > complex**
2. **Short sentences > long paragraphs**
3. **Examples > abstract explanations**
4. **Screenshots > walls of text**
5. **Assume the reader is new to the project**

## Style Rules

- Use headings and bullet points
- Use code blocks for commands and config
- Avoid unexplained jargon
- Prefer diagrams when describing flows

## Jargon Translation Examples
