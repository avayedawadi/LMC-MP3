# FAQ & Common Mistakes

## FAQ

### Do I have to document everything?

No. You need to document **anything that would be hard for someone else to figure out** if you disappeared.

### What if I don't fully understand the feature yet?

Document what you know, and add an "Open Questions" section.

### What if the nonprofit doesn't reply?

Reach out to your EM/PM. There should be a clear escalation path.

## Common Mistakes

- Only documenting in Slack instead of persistent docs
- Writing PRs with one-line descriptions
- Overexplaining obvious things while skipping edge cases
- Forgetting to update docs when behavior changes
- Using overly academic or formal language
