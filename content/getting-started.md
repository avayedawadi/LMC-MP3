# Getting Started

This page is for **new members** of Bits of Good (but can be useful for everybody).

## What is Technical Communication?

In the specific context of Bits of Good, technical communication means bridging the gap between the specifics of the technical implementation that our developers implement, and the needs of our nonprofit partners and team members.

## Effective Technical Communication at Bits of Good

This means a few things, specifically, we need:
- To be as clear as possible in ALL of our communication
- Understand our audience, their needs, and their understanding
- To have clear goals of what we are trying to accomplish for our stakeholders
- Keep clear and understandable records of all work, to make future maintenance easier.

## Why It Matters

Proper technical communcation matters in order to have trust from our stakehodlers, sutainability in our practices so that our projects can live on for years, and efficiency in the velocity at which we can do work and help our community.

## What Technical Communication Means Here

Technical communication is how we:
- Write specs and requirements
- Document decisions and tradeoffs
- Explain how features work
- Communicate changes to nonprofits
- Keep projects maintainable after we graduate
