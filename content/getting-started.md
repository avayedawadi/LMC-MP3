# Getting Started

This page is for **new members** of Bits of Good (but can be useful for everybody).

## What Technical Communication Means Here

Technical communication is how we:
- Write specs and requirements
- Document decisions and tradeoffs
- Explain how features work
- Communicate changes to nonprofits
- Keep projects maintainable after we graduate

## First Week Checklist
